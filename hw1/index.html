		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		To rasterize triangles, I began by first writing the point-in-triangle test. I stored the value of the test in three variables labeled loc1, loc2, and loc3. Then, using an if statement, I checked the values to see where the point was. 
		If it was on or in the triangle, I filled the pixel. To fill in the whole triangle, I wrote a double for loop that had y on the outside and x on the inside. To not have to check every pixel on the screen, I had a boolean that when the for loop 
		landed in the triangle, was true. Once the for loop left the triangle, it was set to false and the inside loop was broken to go onto the next y level.
		
		<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				<td style="text-align: center;">

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		I implemented Supersampling by first taking the sample buffer and making (width * sampling rate x height * sampling rate).
		Then in rasterize_triangle, I divided the pixel into sampling rate x sampling rate. With this, I could then draw into the 
		sample buffer. I encountered a very big wall though when I began trying to resolve the sample buffer into the frame buffer.
		At first, I tried to just add up the number of sub-pixels that were hit in the pixel to then divide by the sampling rate to
		get the percentage; but I almost instantly got stuck on what to do with the number I got. So I restarted, and eventually got 
		system to add up the values at those individual values to take an average over the square sampling rate (because this is what
		the pixel was divided into). Then I took these individual r, g, and b values to translate them into the rgb_framebuffer_target.
		<br>
		<br>
		Supersampling is useful because when we convert the continuous scene to a discrete screen, it's very common to get jaggies and 
		disconnected pixels that are part of the same shape. Supersampling allows us to to sample these otherwise skipped points without
		having to increase the resolution. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Looking at the example below, we can see that the corner gradually got more and more connected until it looks good enough. This 
		is because the triangle got so fine/thin in that corner that it slipped through the pixels. With the supersampling though, we were
		able to capture that otherwise lost sampling. I would argue even at 4x sampling, the overall image looks good. You only begin to 
		see those issues when you zoom in.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		This one was pretty straight forward, I just implemented the matrices as they are defined. Below, I tried to make the robot look like it's doing the wave.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Berycentric coordinates is a way to get an interpolated value by taking the weight of each vertex. The distance from the vertex determines how much that value
		(whatever value we may be trying to interpolate). 
		<br>

			<figcaption>How I think of berycentric cooridnates.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<br>
		<br>
		Above, you see that each vertex corresponds to a color and the distance to that vertex determines how much of that color is at the point we are looking at. 
		Now this is an oversimplification because the weights are actually derived from the areas, but to me this is a much easier way to process the idea.

		Before I had the code all right, I was also able to generate a lot of errors that kind of look like some type of glitch art.
