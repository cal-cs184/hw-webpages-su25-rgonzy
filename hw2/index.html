      <h2>Overview</h2>
      In this homework, I implemented Bézier curves and surfaces to smooth out
      rough meshes. Afterwards, I added Phong shading and mesh upsampling using
      edge-flip and edge-split operations. I enjoyed how both processes boiled
      down to pointer reassignments and element creations. I also thought
      upsampling would be a lot simpler, but I quickly learned otherwise.

      <h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

      <h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
      <p>
        The de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate Bézier
        curves. The idea is that you take a set of control points and
        interpolate between them using linear interpolations until only one
        point remains. I implemented the algorithm by creating a vector of
        Vector2Ds and allocating its size to be one less than the number of
        input points. Although it's usually implemented recursively, I chose an
        iterative approach: in each pass I performed all the lerps and stored
        the results in that vector.
      </p>

      <h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
      <p>
        The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bézier surfaces by applying it in
        both parametric directions (u and v) on an nxn grid of control points.
        First, you perform the algorithm along the u direction on each row of
        control points, which yields n intermediate points defining a Bézier
        curve in u. Then, you apply de Casteljau in the v direction to those
        intermediate points to obtain the final point on the surface at (u, v).
      </p>
      <p>
        I implemented it by first writing the complete de Casteljau algorithm
        using my step function from part 1. This function repeatedly invokes
        step to interpolate the points until only one point remains on the
        curve. Next, I created a surface function that applies this algorithm in
        the u direction to produce a vector of intermediate points. Finally, the
        surface function returns the result of interpolating those intermediate
        points using the v parameter.
      </p>

      <h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I attempted to calculate normals at the vertices directly,
        but then I discovered that each face provides its own normal function.
        To compute a normal, I retrieve one of its halfedges, follow its twin to
        the corresponding face, add that face's normal to a running Vector3D
        sum, and repeat this process around the vertex until I return to the
        starting halfedge. Finally, since Vector3D offers a normalize method, I
        normalize the accumulated sum and return the result.
      </p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
      I began by drawing a diagram of a pair of triangles, labeling all faces,
      halfedges, edges, and vertices. Next, I sketched the edge-flipped pair of
      triangles, again labeling every component and noting the changes. Then I
      stored each element from the original triangles in variables and
      reassigned them according to my notes. Fortunately, it worked the first
      time, so I only needed to simplify the code by removing any unchanged or
      unused variables.

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        <table
          style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse"

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
      <p>
        I implemented the edge split by drawing the before-and-after pairs of
        triangles and tracking every change. I also noted which new elements
        needed to be created. Then, in my code, I assigned all existing
        components to variables, created the new elements, and reassigned
        everything accordingly. Below, you can see my drawings.

        The only debugging I needed was fixing a hole that consistently appeared
        on the left. It turned out I'd missed a single assignment, which I
        spotted quickly.

      <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in upsampling was computing the new positions for each
        vertex. I iterated over all vertices in the mesh and performed the
        following steps: <br /><br />
        1. Determine the weight uu based on the vertex degree n <br />
        2. Sum the positions of all neighboring vertices by traversing its
        incident halfedges. <br />
        3. Compute the new position using \[ 'np' = ((1 - n * u) * pos) + (u *
        sum)\] <br />
        4. Set isNew to false.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I implemented edge splitting by iterating over all edges and
        performing the following steps: <br />
        1: Skip any edge marked isNew to avoid splitting edges that were just
        created. <br />
        2: Retrieve all vertices involved in the split. <br />
        3: If the edge was a boundary, the midpoint would be at
        <code>mid = 0.5 * (v1->position + v2->position)</code>, otherwise it
        would be at the normal
        <code
          >mid = (v1->position + v2->position) * (3.0f / 8.0f) + (v3->position +
          v4->position) * (1.0f / 8.0f)</code
        >. <br />
        4: Then I would set isNew to false, add the edge to a vector, and redo
        until we hit all edges. <br />
        5: Once all edges are collected, run the split on each one, assign the
        stored mid position to the newly created vertex, and record each
        old-to-new edge pair in another vector.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the edges, we could now flip all of them through iteration.
        Although they should be the ones that connect an old and new vertex, I
        still had an if statement that checked if they really were doing that.
        If it was true, I would run flip edge on the edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I updated each vertex's position to the value stored in its
        newPosition variable. To prepare for a subsequent upsampling pass, I
        also set each vertex's isNew flag to false.
      </p>

      <p>
        My most challenging bugs arose in the vertex-position assignment step.
        Every time I upsampled, the mesh became a mess, even though I knew the
        other components were correct. First, I implemented a boundary checker
        that calculate the position as:
        <code>ver->newPosition = 0.75 * ver->position + 0.125 * tot</code>
        if the vertex lay on a boundary. When that didn’t help, I wasn’t sure
        the checker was working, so I asserted that boundary vertices have
        exactly two neighbors. I was stuck for a while because it still failed.
        Eventually, I discovered that my calculation of u was off. I replaced my
        earlier conditional logic with a single expression:
        <code> double u = (deg == 3 ? 3.0 / 16.0 : 3.0 / (8.0 * deg)) </code>
        and even though it technially did the exact same thing, it finally
        worked.

      <p>
        In the pictures above, you can see that after a few splits, the top of
        the torus appears thinner than the rest of the shape. In fact, all the
        original faces vary—thin at the top and thick at the bottom. Moreover,
        the post-split icosahedron still retains slightly visible corners (for
        example, on the left). I fixed this by selecting a vertex and reducing
        its degree with edge flips and additional splits before upsampling.

      <p>
        Above, you can see the cube after a few splits. It may look lopsided
        because the cube;s edges are unevenly divided. In the table, you can see
        that the edges on both sides aren;t oriented the same way, which causes
        the cube to become progressively biased toward one side with each split.

      <p>
        As you can see, after I ensured both sides of the cube had the same edge
        pattern, the cube became perfectly symmetric. This is because all
        operations now apply identically on both sides.
